## Execution Instructions
Open the calculator html in the browser of your choice! The calculator should be fully functional and available to use.

## Managers
Overall: Lucky Katneni
Implementation: James Fitzgerald
Documentation: Ethan Chung
Testing: Liam McDonald
Meeting: Kaushik Jegath

## Sprint #1

Date: October 29th, 2023
Time: 8:00pm
Location: Online
Attendees: All Teammates attended the meeting

Functionality

- Supports all common math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, logarithms, exponentiation, roots.
- The user will be able to interact with the calculator using their keyboard or mouse.
- Get the majority of html framework of the calculator done and start working on the functionality of it.
- A user wants to calculate an addition problem
- A user wants to calculate a subtraction problem
- A user want to calculate a logarithmic problem 
- A user wants to calculate a multiplication problem
- A user wants to calculate a division problem
- A user wants an interactive interface with buttons
- User can hit ‘=’ to get the answer
- The display and the memory can be cleared

Goals
Each member will create the html and functions for his respective operations:
Liam: Multiplication, Division, %, reciprocal (1/x)
Kaushik: Logs, natural log, factorial, and Flip sign
Lucky: Exponents/modulus and Square Roots, buttons, HTML
James Fitzgerald: Numpad functionality
Ethan: Addition, Subtraction, memory, functions

## Sprint #2

11/7/2021

James Fitzgerald: Numpad works and functioning Trig operations with degree and radian mode

Lucky Katneni: Edited operation_handler to account for power and modulus operations and power_modulus is working. Added buttons for them in the calculator.html too.

Kaushik Jegath: Edited row3.js to fix issues with not being able to get the correct elements.

Ethan Chung: Added operationClicked functionality to the operations and the display. Completed clearing and storing information functionality.

Liam McDonald: Finished implementing multiplication and division operations. Added reciprocal functionality. Refactored long code and added documentation to functions and global variables.
