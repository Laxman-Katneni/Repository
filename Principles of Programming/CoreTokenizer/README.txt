List of Files submitted:

coreTokenizer.java: This is the main source file that implements the core tokenizer. It reads an input file and tokenizes it into reserved words, identifiers, integers, special symbols, and errors.
Token.java: This is the helper class that represents a token with a type and value
Documentation.txt: This file has the description of the overall design of the tokenizer, testing details, and any known issues
README: The current file. This has a list of all submitted files, brief descriptions, and instructions on how to compile and run the program
input.txt: This is the sample input file that I used to test the code as given in the project file on carmen

I've implemented this code using Java Language based on the descriptions and requirements given in the project description on files on carmen

To run this program, open the terminal and compile the code using: javac coreTokenizer.java 
After that, execute it using: java coreTokenizer input.txt

I used chatgpt to guide me towards the right direction with the implementation process when I was not getting the desired output to learn from my mistakes
