Material Covered

Use of CSS to create a grid using CSS tags including display, margins, borders, column-start/end, padding, border collapse

Tags used: header, h1, div, p, ul, li, iframe, h3, main, footer, section, hgroup

Embedded ruby code for writing loops to create tables

We used a variety of html tags including main, section, address, abbr, footer, nav. We were able to embed a google maps iframe for the professor's office. Used CSS to style elements with variety of different selector methods of ancestry, classes, and ids. In CSS styles, we used a lot of different styles. We utilized flexboxes and the box model to get the desired spacing between page elements. We made the pages so they can resize automatically without elements going off the screen. With middleman, we configured the layout so the navigation bar and footer would show on every team member's web page. We also used partials for code that we used multiple times. We put data into yaml files and used embedded ruby code to grab it and place it into the html.
